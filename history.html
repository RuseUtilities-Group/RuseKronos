            <h1>Soviet Involvement in Afghanistan</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>On December 24, 1979, the Soviet Union invades Afghanistan, under the pretext of upholding the Soviet-Afghan Friendship Treaty of 1978.</p>
            <p>As midnight approached, the Soviets organized a massive military airlift into Kabul, involving an estimated 280 transport aircraft and three divisions of almost 8,500 men each.</p>

            <h2>Aims of the main people involved</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan to support the Communist Afghan government against the anti-communist Muslim gurreilla forces.</li>
                <li>Devout Muslims and largely anti-communist population resented the extensive land and social reforms imposed the the new Communist government</li>
                <li>Aim of the Soviets was to prop up their new client state under the leadership of Babrak Kamal </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Historical significance of the event within the context of the Cold War</h2>
            <p><span>The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan had a profound long-term impact in the context of the Cold War. The Soviet Union was significantly weakened and never recovered from the public relations and financial losses of their failed invasion. The Soviet army was more accustomed to large scale, conventional forms of warfare such as that of World War II, but the conflict in Afghanistan was completely different. Soviet soldiers of the Red Army were also unable to engage smaller groups of Mujahideen fighters, severely weakening the combat potential of the Soviet Union. The losses in Afghanistan significantly contributed toward the dissolution of the whole USSR in 1991.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>The victories in Afghanistan paved the way for modern terrorist groups, such as the Taliban, Al Qaeda and ISIS in the Middle East. These groups have had a colossal effect on the rest of the world, often performing atrocities of murder, such as the September 11 attacks and the Charlie Hebdo shooting. These terrorist groups were also involved in conflicts against the United States, such as the later War in Afghanistan and the War on Terror.</span></p>
            <h1>Primary source quotations from key people involved</h1>
            <p>&quot;We didn&apos;t push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would...That secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Soviets into the Afghan trap ... The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter 'We now have the opportunity of giving to the Soviet Union its&nbsp;Vietnam War.'&quot;</p>
            <p>&mdash;Zbigniew Brzezinski, National Security Adviser to&nbsp;Jimmy Carter, talking in 1998</p>
            <br>
            <p>&quot;Had it not been for the jihad, the whole world would still be in the Communist grip. The Berlin Wall fell because of the wounds which we inflicted on the Soviet Union, and the inspiration we gave all oppressed people. We broke the Soviet Union up into fifteen parts. We liberated people from Communism. Jihad led to a free world. We saved the world because Communism met its grave here in Afghanistan!&quot;</p>
            <p>&mdash;Burhanuddin Rabbani, President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan (Northern Alliance), in 2002</p>
            <br>
            <p>&ldquo;My opinion of the Russians has changed most drastically in the last week than even (sic) the two-and-a-half years before that. It&rsquo;s only now dawning upon the world the magnitude of the action that the Soviets undertook in invading Afghanistan.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&mdash;President Jimmy Carter, interview with ABC News, December 31, 1979.</p>
            <h2>Historiography (historians' perspectives on the event)</h2>
            <p>When historians discuss the conclusion of the Cold War, the triumph of the West, and the fall of the Soviet Union, they often use the phrase &quot;demise of the Soviet Union.&quot;They frequently begin with the fall of communism and the collapse of the Soviet Union.Invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union in 1979. Of course, the issues that arose as a result of the undoing. Economic malaise, political illegitimacy, and institutional deterioration characterised the Soviet Union.deeper than a misguided foreign intervention Even if the intervention had been successful or never undertaken, the Soviet Union could have disintegrated. However, the top ten. Years of occupation and fighting that followed the invasion wreaked havoc, adding to the death toll.to the Soviet Union&apos;s economic weariness and empire-building pressureThe ground is beginning to buckle.The Brezhnev Doctrine was abandoned as a result of the failure in Afghanistan.Soviet intervention was mandated in order to rescue communism from counter-revolution in neighbouring countries.It also paved the way for Mikhail Gorbachev&apos;s unsuccessful reform initiative.</p>
            <p><span>One of the causes historians believed that called for Soviet intervention was Regional interpretation which emphasises the political and military developments in Afghanistan and surrounding areas as the most important reason for intervention. The ultimate objective of the Soviet was believed to gain control over Iran and the Persian Gulf Area, granting them control over the oil fields. It was also believed that Moscow became accidentally militarily-involved as they had not intended to encourage the coup d&rsquo;etat that brought the Communist-led People&rsquo;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan to power</span></p>
